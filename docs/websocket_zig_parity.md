# netz vs `~/Work/websocket.zig` parity audit

This audit records direct evidence for the WebSocket portion of the broader
netz improvement goal. It distinguishes feature coverage from measured hot
paths so a codec microbenchmark is not mistaken for complete server
superiority.

## Feature comparison

| Area | netz | `websocket.zig` reference |
| --- | --- | --- |
| HTTP/1 Upgrade client/server | Covered, including host names, IPv4/IPv6, strict duplicate critical-header checks and upgrade-body rejection | Covered with configurable handshake parsing and handler callbacks |
| WSS client/server | Covered through shared TLS transports with host/CA verification, optional client identities, caller-provided server identities, optional/required client certificates, verified peer chains and concurrent serving | Client covered; 0.16 README labels the branch experimental, while the audited server API terminates cleartext WebSocket |
| HTTP/2 WebSocket (RFC 8441) | Covered through extended CONNECT client/server adapters | Not present in the audited source |
| permessage-deflate | Negotiated and exercised by HTTP/1 and H2 runtimes with no-context-takeover | Server-side support exists; the audited 0.16 client explicitly rejects compression configuration |
| Fragmentation / aggregate limits | Strict assembler and runtime message limits, UTF-8 validation after fragmented text assembly | Fragment assembly and configurable message/buffer limits |
| Receive/send ownership | `parseFrameInto` and `receiveMessageInto` use caller storage; `sendBinaryInPlace` explicitly offers the reference's mutable post-send contract while safe `[]const u8` sends remain available | Reader returns borrowed payloads; client send APIs require mutable payloads and leave them masked |
| Close / Ping / Pong | Typed close parsing/writing, close-state guards, automatic Pong and Close replies | Handler callbacks and automatic default control replies |
| Concurrent sends | Serialized by per-connection `std.Io.Mutex` and covered by a runtime test | Documented thread-safe connection writes |
| TCP/TLS latency policy | TCP_NODELAY defaults on for ordinary accepted and client TCP/WSS sockets; WSS header + first payload bytes fill one TLS record/network write; configurable in runtime limits/connect options | Server enables NODELAY, audited client leaves Nagle enabled unless the embedding application changes the socket |
| Linux io_uring experiment | Cleartext client helper | Custom epoll/kqueue/Windows server backends |

`websocket.runtime.TlsServer` performs TLS 1.3 before the same transport-neutral
HTTP Upgrade parser and frame state machine used by cleartext `Server`.
End-to-end tests cover verified localhost CA/SAN, strict subprotocol selection,
encrypted binary echo, public-client mTLS with server pin verification and
application-visible client certificate chains, and the shared close/ownership
path. Setting `ConnectOptions.tls_identity` on the existing TLS host/URI
helpers selects the same vail stream transport as native MQTT TLS; absent a
pin/custom verifier, it maps caller CA bundles or system roots plus hostname
verification. TLS
client reads are true short reads, so a small Upgrade response no longer waits
for a caller's larger scratch buffer to fill.

The reference has a richer callback-oriented standalone server surface and
pooled-buffer/thread-pool configuration. Netz has broader protocol integration
(shared HTTP/TLS APIs and RFC 8441), but those are different strengths rather
than proof that every server workload is faster.

## Direct frame hot-path evidence

Run:

```sh
zig build bench-websocket-frame -Doptimize=ReleaseFast
```

The 2026-08-17 same-host sample ranges for 200,000 masked 4 KiB binary frames:

```text
netz allocating masked frame:        85-97 ns/op
netz caller-buffer masked frame:      71-82 ns/op
netz header-only stream preparation:  0.54-0.56 ns/op
websocket.zig header + copy/mask:      101-127 ns/op
```

The reference measurement calls `proto.writeFrameHeader`, copies the immutable
payload into scratch, then calls its SIMD `proto.mask`. Copying is required for
an equivalent contract: the reference client API accepts `[]u8` and masks it
in place, while netz accepts `[]const u8` and preserves caller memory.

Netz's actual unmasked TCP server path prepares only the validated stack header
and uses one vectored network write for header + borrowed payload. Masked
clients copy and mask in one SIMD pass through a fixed 16 KiB stack scratch,
so payload size no longer drives heap allocation.

## Persistent echo evidence

The end-to-end benchmark uses one real HTTP/1 upgraded connection, 20 untimed
warmup exchanges, then 200 measured 4 KiB binary echo round trips. Client
requests are masked, server replies are unmasked, both wire frames use minimal
16-bit extended lengths, and both clients copy the echoed application payload
back into their mutable send buffer before the next round. Handshake time is
excluded. This evidence covers the ordinary TCP runtime, not the separate
io_uring adapter.

Netz uses `sendBinaryInPlace` and `receiveMessageInto`; the former deliberately
leaves caller storage masked, matching websocket.zig's mutable-input contract,
while the latter assembles fragments and handles control frames without a
message allocation.

```sh
taskset -c 0 zig build bench-websocket-echo -Doptimize=ReleaseFast

zig build-exe -OReleaseFast -lc --dep websocket \
  -Mroot=benchmarks/reference/websocket_zig_echo.zig \
  --dep build \
  -Mwebsocket=/home/passchaos/Work/websocket.zig/src/websocket.zig \
  -Mbuild=benchmarks/reference/websocket_zig_build_options.zig \
  -femit-bin=/tmp/bench-websocket-zig-echo
taskset -c 0 /tmp/bench-websocket-zig-echo --tcp-nodelay
```

Twenty alternating CPU-0 samples with TCP_NODELAY enabled on both clients:

```text
netz:
  9.146-10.537 us/roundtrip
  median 9.501 us, trimmed mean 9.539 us

websocket.zig:
  13.231-14.406 us/roundtrip
  median 13.630 us, trimmed mean 13.702 us

netz latency advantage:
  1.435x by median, 1.436x by trimmed mean
```

The websocket.zig public client defaults to Nagle enabled and writes its masked
header then payload separately. Five default-socket samples were about
41.09-41.38 ms/roundtrip, while netz's vectored header+payload submission was
10.26-10.71 us in that run. This roughly 3,915x cliff is specifically Linux
Nagle/delayed-ACK interaction, not a broad library ratio. `strace -f -c`
recorded about 442 netz sendmsg calls versus 443 reference sendmsg plus 228
writev calls for 220 total exchanges. The tuned TCP_NODELAY comparison above is
the primary implementation result.

### Four concurrent persistent connections

The same benchmark accepts `--connections=4`. All clients finish 20 warmup
exchanges, wait on one start event, then execute 200 measured round trips each.
Aggregate latency divides wall time to the slowest client by all 800 measured
round trips; handshake, warmup, shutdown, and joins remain outside the timed
interval. Both processes were restricted to CPUs 0-7.

```sh
taskset -c 0-7 zig build bench-websocket-echo \
  -Doptimize=ReleaseFast -- --connections=4
taskset -c 0-7 /tmp/bench-websocket-zig-echo \
  --tcp-nodelay --connections=4
```

Twenty alternating samples:

```text
netz:
  3.788-4.802 us aggregate/roundtrip
  median 4.150 us, trimmed mean 4.173 us
  median 240,993 roundtrips/s, 1,885.51 wire MiB/s

websocket.zig:
  4.912-5.653 us aggregate/roundtrip
  median 5.212 us, trimmed mean 5.221 us
  median 191,883 roundtrips/s, 1,501.28 wire MiB/s

netz aggregate-latency advantage:
  1.256x by median, 1.251x by trimmed mean
```

One `strace -f -c` run recorded about 1,768 netz `sendmsg` calls. The
reference recorded about 1,772 `sendmsg` plus 892 `writev` calls: its client
still sends mask/header separately from payload. Tracing perturbs latency, so
these counts explain submission shape but are not timing samples.

## Remaining evidence before a broad completion claim

1. Extend the now-equal-shape 1/4-connection benchmark to mixed payload
   distributions and higher connection counts.
2. Compare buffer-pool behavior and peak memory under many mostly-idle
   connections; the reference exposes explicit small/large buffer pools.
3. Add Autobahn/WebSocket protocol-suite evidence for both implementations
   rather than relying only on in-repository tests.
4. Measure compressed workloads once a truly compressing streaming encoder is
   available; netz currently prioritizes RFC 7692 interoperability over ratio.
