# netz benchmark baseline

This file records reproducible local baselines used while working toward the
long-running goal of comparing and improving netz against the HTTP/QUIC
implementations under `~/Work`.

The numbers below are **not** a completion claim.  They are a starting point for
repeatable comparisons: same host, same compiler, explicit commands, and raw
outputs that can be re-run after future optimizations.

### HTTP/3 real-handshake paced transfer

`bench-http3-handshake-transfer` starts a loopback HTTP/3 server, creates a
fresh QUIC/H3 client connection per iteration, streams a fixed-size body in the
selected direction, and reports aggregate bytes/s. Both upload and download
modes use the handshake runtime's paced body sender: `CongestionLimited` and
`FlowControlBlocked` drive peer packet processing so ACK/MAX_* frames can reopen
send credit instead of turning large transfers into synchronous failures.
`--streams` splits the requested byte count across concurrent client-initiated
request streams, matching the shape of quicz's 4-stream aggregate benchmark.

```sh
zig build bench-http3-handshake-transfer -Doptimize=ReleaseFast -- --iterations=1 --body-bytes=16777216 --mode=upload --streams=1
zig build bench-http3-handshake-transfer -Doptimize=ReleaseFast -- --iterations=1 --body-bytes=16777216 --mode=download --streams=1

This is now a real-handshake, paced single-stream and 4-stream upload/download
result with the same 16 MiB transfer size as the quicz reference benchmark
family. It is still not a completion claim: the next evidence step is to run the
same-host quicz reference and add memory/allocation evidence.

## Reference context from `~/Work`

The closest available reference document is
`~/Work/quicz/docs/en/benchmark.md`.  Its headline numbers are not directly
comparable because they were collected on a different platform and with
different benchmark definitions, but they define the comparison target shape:

- quicz real-handshake single-stream throughput: about **310-440 MB/s** on
  macOS loopback, real TLS 1.3 handshake, 8.9 KiB datagrams, no GSO.
- quicz 4-stream aggregate: about **304 MB/s** on the same real-handshake
  benchmark family.
- quicz echo latency: about **21.7 us p50** / **77.3 us p99** for a 1 KiB full
  QUIC round trip after a real handshake.
- quicz documentation also highlights platform effects: Linux GSO/GRO can
  dominate throughput comparisons and must be recorded separately.

For netz, the current results above are microbenchmarks plus paced
real-handshake 16 MiB upload/download benchmarks with single-stream and
4-stream shapes.  These now match the transfer size and aggregate-stream shape
used by the quicz benchmark family, but they still lack the same-host reference
run and memory/allocation evidence required before claiming performance parity
or superiority.

## Gaps before a completion audit can pass

- Run the same or equivalent scenario against at least one `~/Work` reference
  implementation on the same host.
- Record allocation/peak-memory metrics for the benchmark processes.
- Add loss/reordering benchmark cases or interop-runner style scenarios for
  handshake loss, transfer loss, and corruption.
- Keep public HTTP/3 smoke (`https://robotics.bytedance.com/ --verify --head`)
  as a reachability gate, but do not treat it as a throughput benchmark.
